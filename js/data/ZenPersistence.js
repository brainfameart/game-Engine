/**
 * js/data/ZenPersistence.js
 *
 * Shared, tiered key/value persistence used by BOTH the launcher
 * (js/data/store.js, plain <script>) and the editor
 * (editor/state/ProjectStorage.js, ES module, loaded as a plain
 * <script> too — see project/editor/index.html) so a project created/
 * listed in the launcher and a project loaded/autosaved in the editor
 * are reading and writing the exact same underlying storage.
 *
 * Not a module on purpose: the launcher's own js/ tree is plain
 * classic <script> tags (no bundler, no <script type="module">), so
 * this has to be loadable the same way and still be reachable from the
 * editor's ES modules as a shared global (window.ZenPersistence).
 *
 * TIERING STRATEGY (why THREE stores, not one):
 *   - localStorage is synchronous and simple, but small (~5-10MB total
 *     per origin) and shared with every other localStorage user on the
 *     page (ScriptStorage.js, PhysicsLayers.js, etc). Good for small
 *     values: manifests, scene graphs, script source, layer/tag lists.
 *   - IndexedDB has effectively no practical size ceiling on a typical
 *     desktop browser (hundreds of MB to GB) and is the right home for
 *     large values: sprite/audio assets, which are base64 dataUrls and
 *     can individually be multiple MB each. HOWEVER — this is the
 *     important bit that motivated the third tier below — IndexedDB is
 *     NOT actually unlimited: Chrome caps it at a percentage of the
 *     device's free disk space, AND (critically for managed/school
 *     Chromebooks) enterprise policy can cap or clear it far below
 *     what the hardware alone would allow. See ProjectStorage.js's
 *     autosave-failure-warning comment for the user-facing symptom
 *     this produces once a project outgrows that quota.
 *   - File System Access API (FSA) is the one tier that is NOT bound
 *     by the origin's storage quota at all — see fsaMirror below.
 *     Cache Storage and OPFS were deliberately NOT added as additional
 *     tiers: in Chromium both share the SAME origin storage quota
 *     bucket that IndexedDB already uses, so they cannot give a
 *     quota-restricted device any more actual space — they'd only add
 *     real implementation complexity (Cache Storage expects
 *     Request/Response pairs, not arbitrary JSON; OPFS needs a worker
 *     for its synchronous handle API) for zero space benefit over what
 *     IndexedDB already provides. FSA is the only one of the five
 *     storages commonly discussed for this that is genuinely different
 *     from the other two, because it writes to a real file the user
 *     picked, outside the browser's per-origin sandbox entirely.
 *   - Per key, this module tries localStorage FIRST (fast, sync-
 *     feeling). If the value is large enough that it would risk
 *     blowing the localStorage quota (see LARGE_VALUE_THRESHOLD), or a
 *     localStorage write actually throws QuotaExceededError, it falls
 *     back to IndexedDB automatically and removes any stale
 *     localStorage copy of that key. If FSA has been set up (see
 *     fsaMirror below), every write is ALSO mirrored to the granted
 *     directory in the background, regardless of which of the first
 *     two tiers it landed in — that mirror write never blocks or can
 *     fail the overall setItem() result, since FSA support/permission
 *     is optional and best-effort by nature. Reads check localStorage
 *     first, then IndexedDB (never FSA — see fsaMirror's doc comment
 *     for why), so callers never need to know which tier a given key
 *     ended up in.
 *
 * All values are stored as JSON-serializable data; this module handles
 * JSON.stringify/parse internally so callers just pass/receive plain
 * objects.

   * FILE SYSTEM ACCESS API (FSA) — the third, OPTIONAL storage tier.
   *
   * WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE localStorage/IndexedDB TIERING
   * ABOVE, NOT A THIRD RUNG IN THE SAME FALLBACK CHAIN: FSA cannot be
   * used as a normal read/write tier the way IndexedDB is, because of
   * two hard platform constraints that have nothing to do with this
   * codebase:
   *   1. Getting the INITIAL directory handle requires a real user
   *      gesture (a click) — showDirectoryPicker() throws
   *      SecurityError if called from a background timer/interval
   *      with no click in progress. That's why setup is its own
   *      explicit enableFsaBackup() call below, wired to a real button
   *      in the editor (see main.js), not something autosave can just
   *      start doing on its own the first time it runs.
   *   2. Even after the user grants it once, browsers only persist
   *      that permission grant for the current TAB/SESSION in most
   *      cases — a full page reload commonly needs the permission
   *      re-confirmed via queryPermission()/requestPermission(), and
   *      requestPermission() ALSO requires a user gesture the same as
   *      the initial picker. This module cannot silently re-arm it on
   *      boot.
   * Given both of those, FSA is used here as a best-effort MIRROR: once
   * set up, every setItem() ALSO writes the same JSON to a file in the
   * granted directory, purely as a bonus backup that lives outside the
   * origin's storage quota entirely (see the file header's TIERING
   * STRATEGY comment for why that's the one thing FSA offers that
   * IndexedDB/Cache Storage/OPFS cannot). It is never read from by
   * getItem() — localStorage/IndexedDB remain the sole source of truth
   * for what the app actually loads, so a mid-session permission
   * revocation or a tab where FSA was never set up just silently loses
   * the extra backup copy, never the app's actual data. Reading FROM
   * the FSA directory is a manual, explicit action (see
   * restoreFromFsaBackup below) — a deliberate "browse my backups"
   * action, not something that happens implicitly.

   * guaranteed to finish or fail before the page can tear down), the
   * File System Access API's write handle
   * (getFileHandle/createWritable/write/close, all used below) has NO
   * synchronous equivalent — every step is inherently async. That
   * means on a fast tab close/reload, an FSA mirror write that was
   * in flight can still be abandoned mid-write, exactly the race this
   * function's callers otherwise now avoid. In practice this only
   * matters for the LAST edit made in the seconds before closing —
   * every prior autosave tick's mirror already completed while the tab
   * was still open — and the primary save (which the reload/close
   * guard's dirty-tracking is keyed to) is unaffected either way, but
   * it means the FSA backup folder specifically can very occasionally
   * be one revision behind the primary save right after a fast exit.
   * There isn't a way to close this gap without either the browser
   * adding a synchronous FSA write primitive or the editor blocking
   * the unload itself with a custom confirmation UI, which would be a
   * bigger, separate change (a real "are you sure" modal in place of
