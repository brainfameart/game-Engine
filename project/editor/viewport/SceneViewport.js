 * editor/viewport/SceneViewport.js
 *
 * Composes the editor's Scene/Game viewport: creates a PIXI Application,

 * layers editor-only grid + gizmo + camera-frame on top. This is the
 * bridge between editor UI and the actual engine — it's the only
 * viewport file allowed to import from /runtime.
 *
 * Also owns:
 *  - drag-and-drop of a sprite asset from the Project panel into the
 *    scene (creates a new Entity with Transform + SpriteRenderer at the
 *    drop position)
 *  - pointer-driven translate/scale gizmo interaction (see
 *    TransformGizmo.js) and click-to-select on rendered sprites

 *   "area"     — tag this cell with editorState.activeNavAreaIndex,
 *                the area picked in the Toolbar's dropdown while the
 *                O / Nav Area tool is active (see Toolbar.js's
 *                renderNavAreaPicker). Does NOT touch walkable/blocked
 *                at all — a cell can be walkable AND tagged "Water" at
 *                the same time; area is an orthogonal property, not a
 *                4th walkable state.
 *   "erase-area" — clears this cell's area TAG only, reverting it to
 *                slot 0 (Ground) — the Alt+click counterpart to "area"
 *                painting, same relationship "erase" below has to
 *                "walkable"/"blocked". Does NOT touch walkable/blocked
 *                at all, for the same orthogonality reason "area" above
 *                doesn't either.
 *   otherwise  — erase (the Y / Erase tool): clears the manual walkable/
 *                blocked override on this cell, restoring whatever Bake
 *                last produced for it. Does NOT clear the cell's area
 *                tag — erasing a cell's walkable override and clearing
 *                its area are two different actions on purpose, same
 *                as a Tilemap's Erase tool not touching a cell's
 *                collision flag. To clear an area tag, Alt+click with
 *                the Area tool active (see "erase-area" above) instead.
 *
 * Unlike Tilemap's cells (present = filled, absent = empty), a
 * NavWorld2D cell's walkable state has THREE meaningful values —
 * unset/blocked/walkable (see NavWorld2D.js's header) — so "walkable"/
 * "blocked" always write an explicit true/false rather than deleting
 * the key, which would silently fall back to "blocked" per that same
 * convention and could look like erasing did nothing if the cell was
 * already blocked going in.
