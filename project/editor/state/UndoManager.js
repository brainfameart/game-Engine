/**
 * editor/state/UndoManager.js
 *
 * Snapshot-based undo/redo for scene data (entities + components — the
 * same data serializeScene()/deserializeScene() already round-trip for
 * saving a scene to disk). Reusing that serializer instead of hand-
 * tracking every individual mutation (delete this, added that
 * component, changed this field...) means every present AND future
 * scene edit is covered automatically, as long as the call site wraps
 * itself with snapshotNow()/beginEdit()+commitEdit() below — no
 * separate "undo op" class per action type to keep in sync.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT STACKS, gated by which editor is open:
 *   - "scene": Hierarchy / Inspector / Viewport (delete, duplicate,
 *     paste, add entity, add/remove component, field edits, gizmo
 *     drags, tile paint) — active whenever the Animation editor is
 *     closed.
 *   - "anim": the Animation editor's own clip/frame edits (new/delete
 *     clip, delete frame, loop toggle, collider override, frame
 *     reorder) — active only while editorState.animOpen is true.
 * Undo/redo in one never touches the other's stack, and Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+
 * Shift+Z are routed to whichever is currently active (see
 * getActiveScope() below) so each editor's history behaves as its own
 * independent timeline, exactly as requested.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covering the Script Editor — Monaco has its own
 * built-in undo/redo (Ctrl+Z inside the editor already works via
 * Monaco itself); wiring a second, competing undo system into it would
 * only conflict.
 *
 * EDITOR-ONLY FILE.
