/**
 * editor/state/EngineSettings.js
 *
 * Performance settings: independent FPS targets for the editor (when
 * focused vs. unfocused) and for the game/Play window, plus a couple
 * of related toggles. Read by:
 *   - SceneViewport.js's PIXI ticker + StatusBar.js's FPS counter,
 *     which throttle themselves against editorFocused/editorUnfocused
 *     depending on window focus (see FocusScheduler.js).
 *   - PlayWindow.js, which forwards gameFps to the popup via the same
 *     payload it already uses for scene data (window.__ZENGINE_PLAY_PAYLOAD__),
 *     and play-popup.js, which applies it to GameLoop's targetFps.
 *
 * Persistence: a single JSON object in localStorage, same defensive
 * try/catch + in-memory-fallback pattern as PhysicsLayers.js — a
 * sandboxed preview iframe blocking localStorage must never break the
 * editor, worst case settings just don't survive a reload.
 *
 * These are placeholder values today ("Future Settings" — no settings
 * UI exists yet to change them), but every consumer reads through
 * getEngineSettings() rather than hardcoding numbers, so wiring up a
 * real Settings panel later is just adding UI that calls
 * setEngineSetting() — none of the throttling code will need to change.
 *
 * EDITOR-ONLY FILE.
