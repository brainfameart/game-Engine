/**
 * editor/state/FocusScheduler.js
 *
 * Single source of truth for "should the editor be running at full
 * speed right now?" Everything that burns CPU/GPU on a per-frame
 * basis in the editor — the Scene Viewport's PIXI ticker
 * (SceneViewport.js), the FPS/memory/object-count readout
 * (StatusBar.js), and (in future) any other continuous per-frame work
 * — reads its target frame interval from here instead of each
 * maintaining its own focus-detection logic.
 *
 * Priority model (see the Game Window Performance & FPS Priority
 * spec): the GAME never yields to the editor. The editor yields to
 * the game. So "should the editor throttle" is really "is the Play
 * popup open AND currently the focused window" — not simply "is the
 * editor's own window blurred", since the editor should stay at full
 * speed if the person alt-tabs to, say, their code editor or a
 * browser devtools panel with no Play window involved at all. Only
 * the game window actively taking focus away from the editor triggers
 * the throttle-in-favor-of-the-game behavior this spec asks for.
 *
 * Detection combines two mechanisms, since either alone is unreliable
 * across a same-origin popup boundary in some browsers:
 *   1. focus/blur events on both the editor's own window AND the
 *      popup (event-driven — near-instant).
 *   2. A cheap periodic document.hasFocus() poll on both documents as
 *      a safety net (covers the rare case an event is missed, e.g. a
 *      focus change that happens while a tab is backgrounded).
 * Both documents are same-origin (play-popup.html is a plain relative
 * URL — see PlayWindow.js), so document.hasFocus() is available on
 * the popup with no postMessage round-trip needed, same reasoning
 * PlayWindow.js already uses for setPlayWindowPaused().
 *
 * EDITOR-ONLY FILE.
