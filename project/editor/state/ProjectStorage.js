/**
 * editor/state/ProjectStorage.js
 *
 * Automatic, per-project editor persistence — the thing that makes
 * "leave the editor and come back and it's exactly how you left it"
 * true without the user ever touching File > Save Project.
 *
 * This is deliberately a SEPARATE concern from ProjectIO.js's
 * exportProject()/importProject() (the manual "download/upload a
 * .zip" flow, still reachable from the File menu). Both read/write the
 * exact same underlying data shape (manifest + scenes + assets +
 * scripts + layers), just through a different transport:
 *   - ProjectIO.js       -> JSZip -> a downloaded .zip file
 *   - ProjectStorage.js  -> ZenPersistence (localStorage/IndexedDB),
 *                           keyed by the launcher's project id, no
 *                           user action required
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM ScriptStorage.js/PhysicsLayers.js/
 * Tags.js's OWN localStorage calls: those three each persist to one
 * fixed, GLOBAL localStorage key shared by every project (e.g. every
 * project's scripts landed in the same "zengine_scripts" key). That's
 * exactly the bug this feature fixes — this file additionally snapshots
 * their contents into the CURRENT project's own namespaced storage slot
 * and, on load, replaces their global contents with that project's own
 * saved copy, so switching between two different projects in the
 * launcher never leaks one project's scripts/layers/tags into another.
 *
 * STORAGE KEY SHAPE (must match js/data/store.js's project ids, which
 * come from the launcher and are passed to the editor via ?project=):
 *   zenengine.project.<id>.snapshot   -> the full project snapshot (see
 *                                        buildSnapshot() below)
 *
 * EDITOR-ONLY FILE.
