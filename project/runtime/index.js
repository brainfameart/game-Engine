  // whatever container it's given (see systems/LightingSystem.js), and
  // a Filter affects EVERY pixel of its target INCLUDING children added
  // by other code. In the standalone player and the play-mode popup,
  // pixiApp.stage holds nothing but game content anyway, so this would

  // (editor/viewport/SceneViewport.js) adds its OWN sibling containers
  // directly onto pixiApp.stage for the grid, selection gizmo, camera
  // frame, collider outlines, and light gizmos. Those are editor-only
  // chrome that must stay visible/undimmed/unshadowed regardless of
