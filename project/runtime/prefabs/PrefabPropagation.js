/**
 * runtime/prefabs/PrefabPropagation.js
 *
 * The actual "Update Prefab pushes the change out to every existing
 * instance, in every scene, live scene included" behavior — kept
 * separate from PrefabRegistry.js (which only owns the catalogue
 * itself) because this is the one part of the whole prefab feature
 * that has to reach OUTSIDE the currently-loaded World and touch
 * scenes that aren't live right now (see SceneManager.
 * getInactiveScenesEntities()).
 *
 * THE OVERRIDE MODEL (why a prefab update doesn't clobber manual
 * per-instance tweaks): each Entity carries its own prefabOverrides
 * (see Entity.js) — a per-component list of property names that
 * instance has diverged on since it was last synced with its prefab.
 * snapshotEntityComponents() + diffEntityAndRecordOverrides() (a
 * before/after pair) is what populates that list — called from
 * EditorEvents.js around any Inspector field edit on an entity that
 * has a prefabId; updatePrefabFromEntity() is what reads a prefab's
 * new canonical data from one instance and pushes every NON-overridden
 * field out to every other instance; revertInstanceToPrefab() is the
 * inverse — wipes an instance's own overrides and re-syncs it fully
 * from the prefab.
 *
 * WHY DIFF-BASED RATHER THAN HAND-TRACKING EACH EDIT PATH: the
 * Inspector's applyFieldChange() (see EditorEvents.js) has a lot of
 * special-cased branches (SpriteAnimation clip overrides, Collider2D
 * shape-dependent re-seeding, checkbox vs number vs text inputs, etc.)
 * that don't map 1:1 onto "one data-field string = one component
 * property". Rather than duplicate/hook every one of those branches
 * individually (fragile — a future new field type added there could
 * easily forget to also mark itself as an override), the override
 * detector instead snapshots the affected entity's components BEFORE
 * applyFieldChange() runs and diffs them AFTER — any property whose
 * value changed gets marked as an override, regardless of which
 * special-case branch inside applyFieldChange() actually touched it.
 * See EditorEvents.js's two applyFieldChange() call sites for where
 * this snapshot/diff wraps around it.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE.
