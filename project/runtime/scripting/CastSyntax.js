/**
 * runtime/scripting/CastSyntax.js
 *
 * ZenEngine scripts support an editor-only type-cast hint so autocomplete
 * can narrow an Unknown variable's type:
 *
 *   const body = enemy as DynamicBody;
 *   const obj  = enemy as (DynamicBody, Animator, AudioSource);
 *
 * `as` is NOT valid JavaScript — it's TypeScript syntax that ZenEngine
 * borrows purely for IntelliSense (see editor/scripting/ScriptTypeInference.js's
 * CAST_TARGETS / parseCastVariables, which recognize the exact same two
 * forms this file strips). It carries no runtime meaning: the cast target
 * only ever affects which autocomplete suggestions the editor offers.
 *
 * Both the compiler and the editor need the SAME stripping behavior:
 *   - runtime/systems/ScriptSystem.js calls stripCastSyntax() before
 *     handing source to `new Function()`, so `as` never reaches the real
 *     JS parser at all (it would be a hard SyntaxError otherwise — `as`
 *     isn't a JS keyword).
 *   - editor/scripting/ScriptIntelliSense.js calls it before running
 *     Monaco's live syntax check, so a cast is never flagged as a
 *     mistake while typing (see refreshScriptDiagnostics).
 *
 * This lives under /runtime (not /editor) specifically so the runtime
 * compiler can depend on it without ever reaching into /editor — see
 * RULES.txt rule #1. The editor is free to import this file too, same
 * as it imports any other runtime module.
 *
 * STRING/COMMENT SAFETY: the obvious implementation — a plain regex for
 * `\bas\s+Ident\b` over the raw source — is WRONG. It matches the literal
 * two-letter word "as" anywhere at all, including inside string/template
 * literals and comments, e.g. `"he acts as a hero"` or `// same as before`.
 * That silently corrupts real script content (a string a script actually
 * reads/compares/displays gets holes punched in it) rather than just
 * mis-stripping a cast — a much worse failure than a wrong squiggle,
 * since it changes what compiled code actually does. So this file does a
 * single lightweight lexical pass first (strings, template literals,
 * comments, regex literals) and only searches for `as Ident` within the
 * spans that pass identifies as real code — never inside a string,
 * template literal, comment, or regex literal.
 *
 * ENGINE FILE — used by both runtime and editor.

// exactly that.

 *
 * This is a lexer, not a parser: it never builds an AST, just tracks
 * enough state (current quote char, template `${...}` nesting depth,
 * block-comment-open, "was the previous significant token a value" for
