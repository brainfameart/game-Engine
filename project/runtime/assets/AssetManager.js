 *
 * Also defends against a DESTROYED cached texture — this is what fixes
 * the "engine freezes when a texture in use gets deleted" bug. Deleting
 * a sprite asset (AssetRegistry.deleteSpriteAsset -> clearTextureAsset)
 * removes the cache entry AND calls texture.destroy(true) in the same
 * synchronous step, so under normal timing a deleted key's very next
 * resolveTexture() call is already a cache miss and falls through to
 * the missing-texture marker below with no special-casing needed.
 * This extra check exists for every OTHER path that could still hand
 * back a dead texture: a caller (RenderSystem's StrokePath block, any
 * future renderer) holding onto a texture reference from a previous
 * tick across an editor-triggered delete that lands between ticks, a
 * WebGL context loss, or any future code path that destroys a texture
 * without going through clearTextureAsset. A destroyed BaseTexture has
 * null internal GL resources, and PIXI throws when code (a Sprite's or
 * SimpleMesh's `.texture` setter, geometry/UV recompute, etc.) touches
 * certain properties on it — with no try/catch anywhere up the call
 * chain to GameLoop's requestAnimationFrame tick, that throw stops the
 * frame loop from ever rescheduling itself, which is the actual freeze.
 * Checking `.destroyed` here, evicting the stale cache entry, and
 * falling back to the (always-valid, never-user-deletable)
 * missing-texture marker means EVERY situation that could hand a
 * caller a dead texture degrades to a visible magenta placeholder
