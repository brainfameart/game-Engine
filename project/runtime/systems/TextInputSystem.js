/**
 * runtime/systems/TextInputSystem.js
 *
 * Gives each TextInput entity a REAL, invisible HTML <input> element,
 * positioned exactly on top of where its box is drawn on screen. This
 * is deliberate, not a shortcut: hand-rolling text capture from raw
 * keydown events never triggers a phone's on-screen keyboard (there is
 * no way to summon it except by focusing a genuine focusable DOM
 * element), doesn't get IME composition for non-Latin input, and
 * doesn't get copy/paste for free. A real <input> gets all of that from
 * the browser itself — exactly how every production HTML5 game handles
 * typed text. It's made invisible (opacity: 0, but NOT display:none —
 * a display:none element can't be focused) so the PIXI-drawn box in
 * RenderSystem.js is the only thing actually seen; this element only
 * exists to capture real keystrokes and hand them to the component.
 *
 * This system never touches PIXI (RenderSystem.js owns all of that —
 * RULES.txt #5) — it only manages this second, DOM-only, invisible
 * layer, and keeps it positioned in sync with the visible box each
 * frame. Registered in runtime/index.js; needs the canvas element to
 * compute screen positions from, so it's constructed as
 * `new TextInputSystem(pixiApp.view)`.
 *
 * PULSE TIMING — justSubmitted / clearing value on submit:
 * Pressing Enter fires asynchronously (a real DOM event on the
 * browser's own event loop — NOT tied to any requestAnimationFrame
 * boundary) and immediately sets component.justSubmitted = true —
 * component.value is NOT touched at that moment, so it still holds
 * exactly what was typed.
 *
 * Because the keydown can land at ANY point in wall-clock time, it can
 * fire AFTER this system's update() already ran for the current frame
 * but BEFORE ScriptSystem's update() runs later that same frame — in
 * which case ScriptSystem DOES see justSubmitted true that frame. But
 * it can just as easily fire in the gap between one frame's
 * TextInputSystem.update() and the NEXT frame's — i.e. after
 * ScriptSystem already ran for the frame that's currently in flight.
 * If we cleared on the very next TextInputSystem.update() (one stage),
 * that next update() call is guaranteed to run BEFORE that frame's
 * ScriptSystem.update() (system order: TextInputSystem, then
 * ScriptSystem — see runtime/index.js), so the flag would already be
 * false again by the time ScriptSystem gets to check it: it would never
 * observe true at all, even though the DOM input still visibly cleared.
 * This was a real bug (not just a timing edge case) — clearing was
 * effectively decoupled from whether ScriptSystem had ever gotten a
 * turn to read the pulse.
 *
 * Fix: clearing needs a full extra frame of buffer. The pulse is only
 * cleared once it has survived at least one COMPLETE update() where it
 * started the frame already true (i.e. it was set on a PRIOR frame, not
 * the current one) — that guarantees at least one full pass through
 * this frame's ScriptSystem.update() with the flag visible as true,
 * before TextInputSystem clears it back to false on the frame after.
 * See _pendingClear (armed the frame the pulse fires) vs _readyToClear
 * (armed one full update() later — the actual clear only happens here).
 *
 * IMPORTANT — promotion must happen at the END of update(), not the
 * start: a keydown can fire at any wall-clock moment, so by the time
 * THIS update() call runs, _pendingClear may already contain an id the
 * handler just added moments earlier (it's set directly by the DOM
 * listener, not queued for "next frame"). Promoting pendingClear into
 * readyToClear at the TOP of update() — before that same call's clear
 * check runs — collapses the two-stage buffer into one stage: the id
 * gets promoted and immediately cleared again in the same call, so
 * ScriptSystem.update() (later in that same frame) never observes
 * justSubmitted as true at all. Promoting at the END instead guarantees
 * the id sits in readyToClear across a full frame boundary, surviving
 * this frame's ScriptSystem.update() untouched, and is only consumed on
 * the NEXT update() call.
