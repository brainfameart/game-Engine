/**
 * runtime/systems/LightTextureShaderSource.js
 *
 * PHASE 1 of the Unity-URP-2D-style two-phase pipeline (see
 * LightingSystem.js file header for the full pipeline description).
 *
 * This shader draws ONLY light shapes: radial/cone/rect falloff per
 * light type, summed together, with shadow occlusion subtracted where
 * a shadow-casting light's rays are blocked by a ShadowCaster. It has
 * NO knowledge of sprites at all — no uSampler, no scene texture, no
 * per-object color. This is exactly Unity's "Light Render Texture":
 * a screen-space buffer that only contains light color/intensity,
 * rendered once per frame regardless of how many sprites exist.
 *
 * Output channels (see main()):
 *  - rgb: accumulated light color (ambient base + every light's
 *    contribution, additive — matches Unity's per-blend-style Light
 *    Render Texture, which is likewise additive-blended per light).
 *  - a:   total shadow mix (0 = fully lit relative to occluders, 1 =
 *    fully in shadow) — carried in the alpha channel so Phase 2
 *    (SpriteLightFilter.js) can optionally tint shadowed sprite pixels
 *    toward a shadow color WITHOUT this shader needing to know
 *    anything about sprite pixels itself.
 *
 * WHY THIS FIXES "sprites go pure white / pure black": because this
 * buffer holds ONLY light values, sampling it later can only ever
 * MULTIPLY against a sprite's own texture color (see
 * SpriteLightFilter.js) — a light value can dim or brighten a sprite's
 * own color, but it structurally cannot replace it with a flat color,
 * the way the old single-pass filter's additive term could.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE (depends on PIXI's Filter, not on the editor).
 *
 * REALISM PASS (point/spot lights): a flat single-color disc scaled by
 * one smooth brightness curve reads as fake — real light sources shift
 * toward white/hot right at the source and only show their actual
 * tint further out (radialHotness blends uLightColor toward white near
 * the core), and real light scatter is never a mathematically perfect
 * gradient (radialGrain layers a faint two-octave noise texture, rigid
 * to the light's own local space, onto the falloff). Both are additive
 * refinements on top of the existing radialFalloff hot-core curve —
 * area/directional/god-rays/freeform lights are untouched, since none
 * of them represent a single point source a "core" makes sense for.

// Same uniform-budget caps as the single-pass shader this replaced:
// GLSL ES 1.00 requires compile-time-constant array sizes, so lights/
// occluders get a fixed-size cap plus an explicit count uniform that
// tells the shader how much of each array is actually populated.
//
// THESE ARE UPPER-BOUND DEFAULTS, NOT GUARANTEED-SAFE SIZES. The GLSL
// ES 1.00 spec only guarantees MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_VECTORS >= 16 in
// principle, but every real WebGL1 implementation guarantees >= 1024
// (the actual figure that produced "PixiJS Error: Could not initialize
// shader" / "FRAGMENT shader uniforms count exceeds
// MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_VECTORS" on lower-end/integrated GPUs — those
// devices report the guaranteed 1024, not the much higher figure a
// typical dev machine's discrete GPU reports, and the fixed defaults
// below (particularly uPolyPoints at MAX_LIGHTS * FREEFORM_STRIDE = 544
// vec4 slots on their own) blew well past it). resolveCaps() below
// queries the ACTUAL device budget via
// gl.getParameter(gl.MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_VECTORS) and scales these
// down to fit BEFORE the shader source is ever built, so the shader
// that gets compiled always fits the device it's compiling on instead
// of a fixed worst-case guess. buildLightTextureFilter(gl) is the only

/**
 * Builds a fresh PIXI.Filter that renders the light buffer described
 * above. Applied to a dedicated offscreen container (see
 * LightingSystem.js's _renderLightTexture) rather than the sprite
 * container — this filter has zero knowledge of sprites and must never
 * be applied directly to gameContentContainer.
 *
 * gl: the device's WebGLRenderingContext (normally
 * pixiApp.renderer.gl), used to size the shader's uniform arrays to
 * what THIS device's GPU actually supports (see resolveCaps() above) —
 * this is what makes the lighting shader compile on lower-end/
 * integrated GPUs that report a smaller MAX_FRAGMENT_UNIFORM_VECTORS
 * than the DEFAULT_MAX_LIGHTS/OCCLUDERS/FREEFORM_POINTS above assume.
 * Optional: omitting it (or passing a context resolveCaps can't query)
 * falls back to the fixed defaults, same as before this fix.
 *
 * The returned filter carries its resolved caps as
 * filter.lightingCaps = { MAX_LIGHTS, MAX_OCCLUDERS, MAX_FREEFORM_POINTS }
 * so LightingSystem.js can clamp how many lights/occluders it uploads
 * (and warn past that) using the SAME numbers the shader was actually
 * built with, instead of the fixed module constants this file used to
 * export for that purpose.
