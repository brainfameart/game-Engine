/**
 * runtime/systems/LightTextureShaderSource.js
 *
 * PHASE 1 of the Unity-URP-2D-style two-phase pipeline (see
 * LightingSystem.js file header for the full pipeline description).
 *
 * This shader draws ONLY light shapes: radial/cone/rect falloff per
 * light type, summed together, with shadow occlusion subtracted where
 * a shadow-casting light's rays are blocked by a ShadowCaster. It has
 * NO knowledge of sprites at all — no uSampler, no scene texture, no
 * per-object color. This is exactly Unity's "Light Render Texture":
 * a screen-space buffer that only contains light color/intensity,
 * rendered once per frame regardless of how many sprites exist.
 *
 * Output channels (see main()):
 *  - rgb: accumulated light color (ambient base + every light's
 *    contribution, additive — matches Unity's per-blend-style Light
 *    Render Texture, which is likewise additive-blended per light).
 *  - a:   total shadow mix (0 = fully lit relative to occluders, 1 =
 *    fully in shadow) — carried in the alpha channel so Phase 2
 *    (SpriteLightFilter.js) can optionally tint shadowed sprite pixels
 *    toward a shadow color WITHOUT this shader needing to know
 *    anything about sprite pixels itself.
 *
 * WHY THIS FIXES "sprites go pure white / pure black": because this
 * buffer holds ONLY light values, sampling it later can only ever
 * MULTIPLY against a sprite's own texture color (see
 * SpriteLightFilter.js) — a light value can dim or brighten a sprite's
 * own color, but it structurally cannot replace it with a flat color,
 * the way the old single-pass filter's additive term could.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE (depends on PIXI's Filter, not on the editor).
 *
 * REALISM PASS (point/spot lights): a flat single-color disc scaled by
 * one smooth brightness curve reads as fake — real light sources shift
 * toward white/hot right at the source and only show their actual
 * tint further out (radialHotness blends uLightColor toward white near
 * the core), and real light scatter is never a mathematically perfect
 * gradient (radialGrain layers a faint two-octave noise texture, rigid
 * to the light's own local space, onto the falloff). Both are additive
 * refinements on top of the existing radialFalloff hot-core curve —
 * area/directional/god-rays/freeform lights are untouched, since none
 * of them represent a single point source a "core" makes sense for.
