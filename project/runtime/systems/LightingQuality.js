/**
 * runtime/systems/LightingQuality.js
 *
 * The user-facing GPU shadow-quality toggle for LightingSystem. Both
 * modes run entirely inside the same lighting shader (see
 * LightTextureShaderSource.js's `uShadowMode` branch), so switching between
 * them is instant (no shader recompile) and can happen mid-game from a
 * settings menu, not just at scene-load.
 *
 *  - QUAD:      analytic per-pixel test against each occluder's
 *               rotated silhouette-shadow quad (the same geometry the
 *               original CPU LightingSystem filled with PIXI.Graphics)
 *               — cheap, scales with (lights * occluders) per pixel
 *               with simple math, no ray marching.
 *  - RAYMARCH:  a real ray is stepped from the shaded pixel toward
 *               each light and tested against every occluder box along
 *               the way — exact per-pixel occlusion and naturally
 *               correct penumbras, at real GPU cost that scales with
 *               (lights * occluders * marchSteps) per pixel.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE. Pure data, no PIXI.
