/**
 * runtime/systems/LightGlowFilter.js
 *
 * PHASE 3 of the lighting pipeline (new): makes light SOURCES
 * themselves visibly glow in the game view, even over empty
 * background with nothing standing under them — matching how a
 * light in Unity's 2D Renderer is a visible thing in the world, not
 * just an invisible tint that only shows up wherever it happens to
 * land on a sprite.
 *
 * Phase 1 (LightTextureShaderSource.js) already computes a full
 * screen-space "how bright is the light here" buffer. Phase 2
 * (SpriteLightFilter.js) multiplies that into sprites only, so a
 * light in open air (no sprite underneath it) was previously
 * completely invisible. This filter is the missing third leg: it
 * samples the SAME Phase 1 buffer and draws the light's own glow
 * ADDITIVELY over the whole screen — background included — via a
 * dedicated full-screen sprite with PIXI.BLEND_MODES.ADD (see
 * LightingSystem.js's _glowSprite) so every light type is visible as
 * an actual light, everywhere it reaches.
 *
 * Only the EXCESS light above the scene's flat ambient floor
 * (1 - ambientDarkness, the same value baked uniformly into every
 * pixel of Phase 1's buffer) is added — otherwise every pixel on
 * screen would get additively brightened by the ambient floor alone,
 * washing out unlit areas for no reason. Subtracting that floor means
 * only pixels a light ACTUALLY reaches glow, and shadowed pixels
 * (carried in Phase 1's alpha channel) fade the glow back out too, so
 * a light's own glow correctly dims/vanishes behind an occluder just
 * like its effect on sprites does.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE (depends on PIXI's Filter, not on the editor).
