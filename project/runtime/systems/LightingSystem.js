/**
 * runtime/systems/LightingSystem.js
 *
 * GPU-driven 2D lighting, rebuilt to match Unity URP's actual 2D
 * Lighting pipeline: TWO separate rendering phases per frame instead
 * of one all-in-one filter.
 *
 *   PHASE 1 — LIGHT TEXTURE (see LightTextureShaderSource.js):
 *     Every Light + ShadowCaster entity's data is uploaded as uniforms
 *     to a filter that draws ONLY light shapes (radial/cone/rect
 *     falloff, directional fill, shadow occlusion) into an offscreen
 *     PIXI.RenderTexture, in screen space, once per frame. This buffer
 *     has zero knowledge of sprites — exactly Unity's "Light Render
 *     Texture," a screen-space buffer containing only light color,
 *     rendered once and shared by every sprite that samples it.
 *
 *   PHASE 2 — SPRITE SAMPLING (see SpriteLightFilter.js):
 *     Every individual sprite RenderSystem tracks gets its own tiny
 *     PIXI.Filter attached that samples Phase 1's light texture at
 *     that sprite's own screen position and MULTIPLIES it into that
 *     sprite's own texture color. This is exactly Unity's Sprite-Lit
 *     shader step: "spriteColor * lightSample", nothing more.
 *
 * WHY TWO PHASES INSTEAD OF ONE FILTER (what changed from the previous
 * single-pass version): the old system ran one filter over the WHOLE
 * rendered scene and tried to do "read scene pixel, read all lights,
 * composite" in a single shader — which made it easy for a light's own
 * additive color term to overpower/replace a sprite's actual color
 * (visible as "sprites turn white under any light"). Splitting into
 * two phases makes that structurally impossible: Phase 1 NEVER touches
 * a sprite pixel (it only ever produces a light VALUE), and Phase 2's
 * only operation is multiplying that value into each sprite's own
 * color. A light can dim/tint/brighten a sprite; it can never replace
 * its color, and a shadow can never crush a pixel to flat (0,0,0)
 * unless ambientDarkness/shadowColor are deliberately set that way.
 *
 * COORDINATE SPACE: both phases work in the same WORLD-CONTAINER-LOCAL
 * pixel space Transform.x/y already live in (see _syncStageTransform),
 * so light positions need zero extra conversion whether
 * gameContentContainer is panned/zoomed (editor) or camera-follow
 * translated (play mode/player) — same guarantee the old system had.
 *
 * SHADOW MODES: unchanged from the previous version — "quad" (cheap
 * analytic per-pixel box-shadow test) or "raymarch" (true per-pixel
 * occlusion marching), both compiled into Phase 1's single shader and
 * switchable at runtime via LightingSettings.shadowMode (see
 * LightTextureShaderSource.js's uShadowMode branch).
 *
 * If a scene has ZERO light entities, Phase 1's light texture is never
 * rendered and every sprite's SpriteLightFilter is detached, so a
 * light-less scene pays exactly zero extra GPU cost and renders
 * pixel-identical to before lighting existed — same guarantee the
 * previous version made.
 *
 * Both the editor's Scene/Game viewport and the standalone player get
 * identical lighting because both go through this one System, same as
 * RenderSystem (see RULES.txt #5 — rendering is centralized). This
 * file keeps the SAME public shape (class name LightingSystem,
 * constructor(worldContainer, renderSystem, pixiApp), .update(world))
 * as the previous version so runtime/index.js and
 * editor/viewport/SceneViewport.js need no changes.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE (depends on PIXI, not on the editor).
