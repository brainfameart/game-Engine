/**
 * runtime/systems/ScriptSystem.js
 *
 * Compiles and runs user scripts attached via the Script component.
 * Scripts are compiled with `new Function()` — they NEVER touch eval()
 * or the editor's scope. Each script's `this` is an EntityContext built
 * by ScriptAPI (see scripting/ScriptAPI.js), giving it safe access to
 * this.x, this.transform, this.sprite, find(), scene, physics, input,
 * mouse, touch, time, random, and global.
 *
 * Lifecycle events called automatically:
 *   onStart()          — once, before the first onUpdate
 *   onClone()          — once, ONLY on entities created by spawn()
 *                         (see ScriptAPI.spawn()), called right
 *                         BEFORE onStart() on that same instance. Never
 *                         fires for entities loaded from the scene file.
 *   onUpdate(dt)       — every render frame
 *   onClick()          — the frame the mouse/a finger is pressed while
 *                         over this entity's collider (needs Collider2D)
 *   onFixedUpdate(dt)  — at a fixed 60 Hz timestep (accumulator)
 *   onCollision(other)      — when this entity's collider touches another (enter)
 *   onCollisionEnter(other) — alias for onCollision; prefer this for clarity
 *   onCollisionStay(other)  — every physics step the collider is STILL
 *                             touching another, from the step after Enter
 *                             up to (not including) the step Exit fires
 *   onCollisionExit(other)  — when this entity's collider stops touching another
 *   onTriggerEnter(other)   — when entering a trigger collider
 *   onTriggerExit(other)    — when leaving a trigger collider
 *   onDestroy()       — once, when the entity is destroyed / scene ends
 *   onStateEnter()     — fired by this.state.change(name) right after
 *                         switching TO a new state (see fireStateChange()
 *                         and scripting/components/StateAPI.js). Needs
 *                         no component — this.state works on every
 *                         entity automatically.
 *   onStateUpdate(dt)  — every render frame, right after onUpdate,
 *                         regardless of whether this.state.change() was
 *                         ever called (this.state.current defaults to
 *                         "default"). Use this.state.current to branch.
 *   onStateExit()      — fired by this.state.change(name) right before
 *                         switching AWAY from the current state.
 *   onHearSound(source) — fired by AudioListenerSystem the frame a 3D
 *                         AudioSource enters this entity's Audio
 *                         Listener radius (needs an Audio Listener
 *                         component — see components/AudioListener.js).
 *   onLoseSound(source)  — the frame that source leaves range (or is
 *                         destroyed while in range).
 *
 * FAULT ISOLATION: a thrown error inside one lifecycle CALL is caught
 * right there and reported — it does NOT disable the whole script
 * instance anymore (except onStart, see below). A bug in onUpdate this
 * frame just means this entity's onUpdate is skipped THIS frame; next
 * frame it's called again like normal. One bad line doesn't stop the
 * rest of the game, and doesn't even stop the rest of THIS script.
 * The only lifecycle that still disables the instance after a failure
 * is onStart: it only ever runs once, so there's nothing to "retry
 * next frame", and letting onUpdate run against state onStart never
 * finished setting up would likely just throw again immediately anyway.
 *
 * ERROR CLASSIFICATION: scripting/components/*API.js tag thrown Errors
 * with a machine-readable `err.kind` —
 *   "missing-component"     this.rigidbody/.sprite/etc but the entity
 *                            doesn't have that component at all
 *   "unsupported-body-type" e.g. this.rigidbody.addForce() on a
 *                            Kinematic/Static body
 *   "unknown-api"            this.rigidbody.addFrce() — property/method
 *                            that doesn't exist at all (a typo)
 * Anything without a `kind` (a plain script bug — null deref, bad
 * logic, etc.) is reported as "script-error". _formatError() below
 * turns each kind into a specific, actionable one-line message rather
 * than a generic "X is not a function".
 *
 * REPEAT THROTTLING: the same error firing every frame (e.g. an
 * onUpdate bug) would otherwise spam the console 60x/second. Identical
 * (script, method, message) errors are reported immediately once, then
 * suppressed and finally summarized with a repeat count — see
 * _shouldReport().
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE.

  /**
   * Compiles user source into a factory function. The factory is called

   * whichever lifecycle handlers the user declared, PLUS every other
   * top-level function they wrote (see "CUSTOM FUNCTIONS" below).
   *
   * CUSTOM FUNCTIONS AND `this`:
   * A user's own helper function — e.g. `function chase() { ... }`
   * called as a bare `chase()` from inside onUpdate() — is NOT one of
   * the fixed lifecycle hooks the engine calls directly, so without
   * help it never gets `this` bound to the entity the way onStart/
   * onUpdate/etc. do (that binding happens via `handler.call(context,
   * ...)` in _initEntityScripts()/_invoke(), which only ever touches
   * the fixed lifecycle-hook names below). Left alone, `chase()`
   * called bare runs with `this === undefined` (scripts execute in
   * strict mode — see the "use strict" prologue below), so `this.x`
   * inside it throws — a confusing trap for anyone who reasonably
   * expects a function declared right next to onUpdate() to behave
   * the same way.
   *
   * Fixed with a lightweight pre-scan (_extractTopLevelFunctionNames,
   * below) that finds every `function name(...) { ... }` declared at
   * the top level of the user's source — same shallow, indentation-
   * agnostic scan already used for the fixed lifecycle names, just
   * generalized to catch arbitrary ones too. The generated wrapper
   * then REBINDS each of those local function bindings to the entity
   * context right inside the sandboxed source itself (a top-level
   * `function foo(){}` declaration is an ordinary reassignable local
   * binding, same as `var foo`, so `foo = foo.bind(__ctx);` works) —
   * this has to happen inside the generated code, not from outside
   * after factory() returns, because a bare call like `chase()`
   * resolves to whatever the LOCAL `chase` binding currently points
   * to; handing a bound copy back out in a side object wouldn't
   * change what the bare identifier inside the script itself refers
   * to. `__ctx` is a real parameter now (see the factory() call in
   * _initEntityScripts(), which creates the entity context BEFORE
   * calling factory() specifically to make this possible), so a plain
   * top-level `function chase() { this.x }` just works when called
   * bare, exactly like onUpdate() does. No `this.chase()`, no

   * keep firing against an entity — or an entire scene — that no

   * wait()/repeat() — read from this._activeContext, the same "who's
   * currently running" tracking _invoke() already maintains for every
   * other lifecycle call. That entity is the timer's owner:

   *     fires (or fires again, for repeat()), the timer is cancelled —
   *     see _flushDestroyed()'s call into _cancelTimersForEntity()
   *     below.
   *   - if the SCENE restarts or switches, ALL timers are cancelled —
   *     see destroy() below, the same whole-scene teardown that
   *     already clears every script instance.
   * Either way the callback simply never runs again; nothing throws,
   * nothing needs to check this.destroyed inside the callback itself.
   *
   * The callback runs with `this` bound to the OWNER's own
   * EntityContext (via _invoke, same as onUpdate/onStart/etc.), so
   * `this.x`, this.destroy(), this.wait(...) all work naturally inside
   * it, exactly like any other lifecycle method:
   *   function onStart() {
   *     wait(2, function () { this.visible = false; });
   *   }
   *
   * A timer scheduled from OUTSIDE any lifecycle call (e.g. accidentally
