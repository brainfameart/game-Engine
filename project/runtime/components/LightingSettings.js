/**
 * runtime/components/LightingSettings.js
 *
 * Scene-wide lighting/shadow REALISM settings, exposed to end users of
 * the engine (not just the person building the engine) through the
 * Inspector — same idea as Camera's enablePseudo3D: a single toggle
 * that isn't "per light" or "per object," it's a property of the whole
 * scene, so it lives as plain data on a component (see RULES.txt #4)
 * that LightingSystem reads every frame (see LightingSystem.js's
 * _readSettings()).
 *
 * Attach this to any one entity in the scene (the Main Camera is a
 * natural home, same as other scene-wide settings) — if a scene has
 * none, LightingSystem falls back to sensible defaults matching the
 * previous hardcoded behavior, so existing scenes keep working
 * unchanged.
 *
 * FIELD GUIDE (what each one actually changes visually):
 *  - shadowMode:      "Quad" = cheap analytic shadows, closely matches
 *                      the classic look, cheapest on low-end machines.
 *                      "Raymarch" = true per-pixel shadow occlusion,
 *                      correct penumbra/soft edges, costs more GPU
 *                      time per light * occluder * pixel.
 *  - raymarchSteps:    Only matters in Raymarch mode. Higher = smoother
 *                      / more accurate shadow edges and fewer thin-
 *                      occluder "shadow leaks," at a higher GPU cost.
 *                      Lower = cheaper but can look slightly rougher.
 *  - ambientDarkness:  How dark the world gets in areas NO light
 *                      reaches, from 0 (no darkening at all, full
 *                      daylight everywhere) to 1 (pitch black outside
 *                      any light's reach). This is the single biggest
 *                      "how moody/realistic does my lighting look"
 *                      dial — most atmospheric/horror-style scenes
 *                      want this high (0.7-0.9); brighter, cartoonish
 *                      scenes want it low (0.2-0.4).
 *  - glowStrength:     How visible a light's OWN glow is in open air —
 *                      i.e. how brightly a light shows up over empty
 *                      background with nothing standing in it, not
 *                      just where it happens to land on a sprite (see
 *                      systems/LightGlowFilter.js). 0 = a light is
 *                      only ever visible through what it lights up
 *                      (the old behavior); 1 = a normal visible glow,
 *                      matching Unity's 2D lights actually being
 *                      visible light sources, not invisible tint
 *                      generators. Higher values push the glow
 *                      brighter/further for a more "hot" look.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE. Pure data, no PIXI.
