/**
 * runtime/components/Rigidbody2D.js
 *
 * Plain physics-body data, mirrored 1:1 to a real Rapier RigidBody by
 * runtime/physics/PhysicsWorld.js — no physics math and no Rapier
 * objects live on the component itself, so it stays trivially
 * serializable (RULES.txt section 4).
 *
 * bodyType decides which fields are actually meaningful:
 *  - Dynamic:   full simulation. mass/gravityScale/damping/lockRotation
 *               all apply; Rapier integrates forces + collisions. A
 *               CharacterController (see components/CharacterController.js)
 *               can still drive a Dynamic body's velocity directly —
 *               see the driveVelocityX/driveVelocityY fields below —
 *               while Rapier's own gravity/solver still owns everything
 *               else (falling, being pushed, landing).
 *  - Kinematic: moved by code/animation, not forces. Only velocity
 *               (used to move it) and lockRotation apply; mass, drag,
 *               and gravity are ignored by a kinematic body.
 *  - Static:    never moves. None of the dynamic-only fields apply —
 *               only the body exists as an immovable collider anchor.
 * The Inspector (editor/panels/Inspector.js) reads bodyType to decide
 * which of these fields to actually show, matching Unity's convention
 * of hiding body-type-irrelevant settings.
