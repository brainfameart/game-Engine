 * Plain data describing WHICH movement scheme an entity uses (Character
 * Controller / Platformer / Top-Down / Car / Follow / Patrol / Free) and that
 * scheme's tunables (move speed, jump force, acceleration, etc). This
 * is the "movement type" (a.k.a. controller type) the Inspector's Add
 * Component menu offers, per the same Unity-style convention
 * Rigidbody2D/Collider2D already follow (RULES.txt section 4: plain
 * data only, no behavior).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this component does NOT implement its own physics. All
 * actual force/velocity integration and collision detection still goes
 * through Rapier via Rigidbody2D + runtime/physics/PhysicsWorld.js —
 * see runtime/systems/ControllerSystem.js, which reads this component
 * each frame and only ever writes into Rigidbody2D's velocity fields
 * (the same fields the Inspector's Kinematic velocity sliders already
 * write to), never touching Rapier directly. An entity needs a
 * Rigidbody2D (Kinematic works best) for this component to have any
 * physical effect — CharacterController describes intent/tuning,
 * Rigidbody2D + Rapier still do the actual moving and colliding.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE.
