/**
 * runtime/components/Light.js
 *
 * Light descriptor, modeled after Unity's 4 light types (adapted to 2D):
 *
 *  - Directional : uniform light across the whole scene from one angle,
 *    like sunlight. No position falloff. `rotation` (degrees) sets the
 *    direction shadows/gradient would lean, `intensity` sets brightness.
 *    When castShadows is on, shadows are PARALLEL (every occluder's
 *    shadow points the same direction, set purely by this light's
 *    rotation) rather than radiating from a position — exactly like
 *    real sunlight, where the sun's position doesn't matter, only its
 *    angle in the sky. Computed per-pixel in Phase 1 of the two-phase
 *    lighting pipeline's GPU shader (see
 *    systems/LightTextureShaderSource.js's directional-light shadow
 *    branch, which derives an effective light position from rotation
 *    alone rather than reading this entity's Transform position).
 *  - Point       : radiates outward from the entity's Transform position
 *    in all directions, fading out at `radius`. The classic "lightbulb".
 *  - Spot        : radiates from the entity's Transform position within
 *    a cone (`angle` degrees wide, aimed along `rotation`), fading out
 *    at `radius`. Good for flashlights / focused beams.
 *  - Area        : uniform light emitted from a rectangular region
 *    (`width` x `height`) centered on the entity's Transform position,
 *    with a soft `radius`-sized falloff at the rectangle's edge.
 *  - GodRays     : a 5th type beyond Unity's stock 4 — bright,
 *    streaked shafts of light radiating within a cone (`angle` degrees
 *    wide, aimed along `rotation`, reaching out to `radius`), like
 *    sunlight breaking through clouds or a window. Uses the same
 *    fields as Spot (radius/angle/rotation) but the Phase 1 shader
 *    modulates its brightness with a streak pattern instead of a flat
 *    cone (see LightTextureShaderSource.js's typeId==4 branch).
 *
 * All types share color/intensity so the Inspector and the Phase 1
 * light-texture shader can treat them uniformly where the math allows,
 * while type-specific fields (radius/angle/width/height) only apply to
 * the relevant type.
 *
 * Every light type is also visibly a LIGHT SOURCE, not just an
 * invisible tint generator: on top of dimming/brightening sprites
 * (Phase 2, SpriteLightFilter.js), each light's own glow is drawn
 * additively over the whole screen — background included — by Phase 3
 * (see systems/LightGlowFilter.js and LightingSystem.js's
 * _glowSprite), matching Unity's 2D lights actually being visible
 * where they shine, not just where they happen to land on something.
 *
 * This component is PLAIN DATA ONLY (see RULES.txt #4) — actually
 * darkening/lighting the world and sprites is LightingSystem's job
 * (runtime/systems/LightingSystem.js, which now orchestrates a
 * two-phase pipeline — see that file's header), not this file's.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE.
