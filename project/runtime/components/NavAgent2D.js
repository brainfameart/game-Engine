/**
 * runtime/components/NavAgent2D.js
 *
 * Plain data describing ONE agent's navigation settings against the
 * scene's shared NavWorld2D (see components/NavWorld2D.js). Add this
 * component to any entity that should move over the shared nav data —
 * many entities can each have their own NavAgent2D pointed at the SAME
 * NavWorld2D, with no per-agent navigation world and no per-agent bake
 * (see systems/NavWorldSystem.js's header for the full pipeline).
 *
 * Field groups mirror the requested Inspector layout, with one change
 * from the original spec — see the "Navigation" note below:
 *
 *   NAV AGENT 2D
 *   Agent
 *       Radius
 *   Movement
 *       Speed
 *       Acceleration
 *       Deceleration
 *       Stopping Distance
 *   Pathfinding
 *       Auto Repath
 *       Repath Interval
 *       Repath Distance
 *   Avoidance
 *       Enabled
 *       Priority
 *   Collaboration
 *       Enabled
 *       Group Radius
 *   Navigation
 *       Area Mask
 *
 * Deliberately 2D-only: no agent height, no 3D radius/slope/step-offset
 * fields — this is a 2D grid system, not a port of a 3D nav agent.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this component does NOT implement movement or pathfinding
 * itself. All real path queries/erosion-by-radius go through
 * NavWorld2D's getAgentNavLayer() + pathfinding/AStar.js, wired via
 * NavWorldSystem.js — same "plain data only, systems do the work"
 * convention as Rigidbody2D/CharacterController.
 *
 * RUNTIME-ONLY FILE.
